  * @date      25-August-2011
  * @brief     STM32F4xx Devices vector table for RIDE7 toolchain. 
  *            This module performs:
  *                - Set the initial SP
  *                - Set the initial PC == Reset_Handler,
  *                - Set the vector table entries with the exceptions ISR address
  *                - Configure the clock system and the external SRAM mounted on 
  *                  STM3220F-EVAL board to be used as data memory (optional, 
  *                  to be enabled by user)
  *                - Branches to main in the C library (which eventually
  *                  calls main()).
  *            After Reset the Cortex-M4 processor is in Thread mode,
  *            priority is Privileged, and the Stack is set to Main.
